# DollarGame
Implementation of the graph theory dollar game

Inspired by this [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ).
Distribute value to connected nodes by left clicking a node. Take value from connected nodes by right clicking. The objective of the game is to eliminate all negative values. Higher difficulties have less surplus value in the graph.
